# Multithreaded Ludo Game â€“ Operating Systems Project

## Overview

This project is a multithreaded implementation of the classic board game **Ludo** using **C++**. The game supports up to four players and is designed to demonstrate core operating system concepts including:

- Threads
- Mutexes
- Semaphores
- Conditional Variables

Each player in the game is represented by a separate thread, ensuring concurrent gameplay while maintaining synchronization and consistency using OS-level primitives.
